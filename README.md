## Programs

### Headers

If you'd like to include one of these in your program, go to the wiki on the right and see what you need to include.  If you want to include all of them, type the following:

    #include "include.h"

* `preprocessor_checks.h`
  - Checks a few preprocessor defines to make sure you're using RobotC in NXT/TETRIX mode as well as FTC mode.  Also checks for the latest firmware version.

* `autonomous_functions.h`
  - Functions generally useful for a simple autonomous routine

* `TeleOp_functions.h`
  - Drive functions for use in the Tele-Operation phase

* `vector.h`
 - A vector math library

* `typedefs.h`
 - Typedefs that are used in the other headers, all consolidated into one file
